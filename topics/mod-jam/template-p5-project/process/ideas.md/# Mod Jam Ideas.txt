1. Frog is after bananas instead of flies
    /
2. Frog increases slightly in size after each fly caught
    /
3. Flies are of various different colours, and the frog turns the colour of each fly it catches
    /
4. Certain flies are marked poison, and the frog dies if it catches a poison fly
    /
5. Certain flies are mutant, and the frog gets two tongues that go off in separate directions if it catches a mutant fly
    /
6. Certain flies are armed with bullets and are shooting at the frog, if hit, the frog dies
    / Frog must catch the fly before being hit. Should the frog be able to move to avoid bullets?
7. Multiple flies on screen at a time. Frog much catch them all before a count-down timer reaches 0
    /
8. The background slowly fades from blue to sunset to night-time. At dusk, the flies turn into glowing fireflies
    /
9. The black pupils of the frog's eyes briefly turn to red hearts when a fly is caught
    /
10. The frog says "niiiiice" when it catches a fly
