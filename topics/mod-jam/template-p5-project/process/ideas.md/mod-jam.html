# Mod Jam Ideas

## 1. Frog is After Flying Bananas Instead of Flies
What if the frog was after flying bananas instead of flies?
Maybe he gets a monkey-ears costume and there's a silly monkey sound when he catches one.
The banana could boomerang around the screen, not just fly straight.

## 2. Control Switches From the Frog to the Fly
Instead of playing as the frog, you control the fly.
The frog sticks his tongue out randomly and you have to dodge.
The fly moves with your cursor. Basically: don’t get caught.

## 3. Flies Are Different Colours and the Frog Changes Colour Too
Each time the frog catches a fly, he turns the same colour.
Catch a red fly → red frog. Yellow fly → yellow frog.
Only one fly on screen at a time to keep it simple.

## 4. Poison Flies Kill the Frog
Some flies are poisonous. If the frog catches one, he dies.
There could always be 6 flies on screen: 2 poisoned, 4 safe.
When a fly gets caught, a new one comes in to keep the balance.

## 5. Mutant Flies Give the Frog Two Tongues
Every third fly is a mutant.
If the frog catches one, he temporarily gets two tongues that shoot out at different angles.
Harder to control. Weirder look—maybe purple and spotted with freaky yellow eyes.
Instead of the normal “slurp,” the tongue makes a weird noise.
Mutant effect disappears when you catch a regular fly.

## 6. Some Flies Shoot Bullets
Certain flies are armed and shoot at the frog.
If the frog gets hit, game over.
Maybe he can move to avoid getting hit?
Flies like this would have to move a little slower to give the player a fair shot.

## 7. Timer Mode: Catch Them All Before Time Runs Out
There’s a countdown—like 15 seconds.
10 flies on screen. You have to catch them all before time's up.
Adds urgency. Fast-paced chaos.

## 8. Background Shifts From Day to Night—Then Fireflies!
The sky slowly fades from blue to orange to pink to purple to night.
When it hits dusk, the flies become glowing fireflies.
This whole cycle loops every minute or so. Pretty and atmospheric.

## 9. Frog's Pupils Turn to Hearts When a Fly Is Caught
Just a little visual thing.
When the frog catches a fly, his pupils briefly turn into red hearts.
Cute, subtle, fun.

## 10. The Frog Says "Niiiiiice" When Catching a Fly
Swap the current “gulp” sound with a chill voice that says “niiiiice.”
Gives the frog more personality—laid-back, super cool guy.

## 11. Scuba Frog (Underwater Mode)
Frog gets a snorkel and everything’s underwater.
Background changes: seaweed, bubbles, maybe some fish swimming by.
Could affect how well you see the flies, so it adds difficulty too.

## 12. Space Frog (Outer Space Mode)
Frog is in space now. He’s got a little helmet on.
Background is black with stars, planets, moons.
Like Scuba Frog, maybe the lighting or clutter makes it harder to spot the flies.

## 13. The Fly Drops Down Toward the Frog—Stop It!
Each fly starts at the top of the screen and slowly drops down.
It moves side to side erratically while falling.
If it reaches the frog, game over.
You have to catch it before it gets to him.

## 14. Flies Get Smaller Over Time
First fly is big and easy to catch.
Then each new one is a bit smaller.
Eventually it’s teeny tiny or practically invisible.
Just gets harder and harder the longer you play.

## 15. Flies Are Trapped in Balloons
Red balloons float up from the bottom of the screen.
Inside each one is a fly.
The frog has to pop the balloon with his tongue to release the fly before it drifts off the top.
Maybe a new balloon shows up every 15 seconds or so?
The balloon moves slowly, but the fly inside is fast once it’s out.

## 16. Frog VS AI Frog
There are two frogs: one on the bottom (you), and one on the top (AI frog).
They both compete to catch flies.
Maybe they face each other? Add a little scoreboard showing who’s winning.

## 17. Galaga Frog
Retro arcade-style.
Flies start at the top of the screen and dive-bomb at you in straight, quick lines.
Frog has 5 lives. Each hit = one life gone.
Flies attack faster and more frequently over time.
Track your high score based on how long you stay alive / how many you catch.

## 18. Lazy Frog
Every fly caught makes the frog wider—but slower.
So now he covers more area, but the tongue moves sluggishly.
Trade-off between speed and size.
Could be hilarious if he gets huge.

## 19. Seasonal Frog
The game changes depending on what month it is.
- **Spring**: pink background, catching blossoms or Easter eggs with wings
- **Summer**: blue background, catching flying suns
- **Autumn**: orange background, catching red leaves
- **Winter**: dark blue background, catching snowflakes
They all behave like flies—just themed to the season.

## 20. Beautician Frog
Instead of flies, it’s flying makeup.
Catch lipstick → frog gets red lips.
Catch blush → pink cheeks.
Catch mascara → long eyelashes.
Maybe there’s even different colours. Like purple blush or orange lipstick.
Could one of the flies be makeup remover? Reset the look if you want.
Kind of a dress-up game hidden inside the fly-catching.
